</h3>

<p>In this work, we present an interactive system for visual analysis of urban traffic congestion based on GPS trajectories. For these trajectories we develop strategies to extract and derive traffic jam information. </p>

<ul>
<li>After cleaning the trajectories, they are matched to a road network. </li>
<li>Subsequently, traffic speed on each road segment is computed and traffic jam events are automatically detected. Spatially and temporally related events are concatenated in, so-called, traffic jam propagation graphs. </li>
</ul>

<p>These graphs form a high-level description of a traffic jam and its propagation in time and space. Our system provides multiple views for visually exploring and analyzing the traffic condition of a large city as a whole, on the level of propagation graphs, and on road segment level. Case studies with 24 days of taxi GPS trajectories collected in Beijing demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.</p>

</h3>

<p>We propose a novel two-step mining and optimization framework for inferring the root cause of anomalies that appear in road traffic data. We model road traffic as a time-dependent flow on a network formed by partitioning a city into regions bounded by major roads. </p>

<ul>
<li>In the first step we identify link anomalies based on their deviation from their historical traffic profile. However, link anomalies on their own shed very little light on what caused them to be anomalous. </li>
<li>In the second step we take a generative approach by modeling the flow in a network in terms of the origin-destination (OD) matrix which physically relates the latent flow between origin and destination and the observable flow on the links. The key insight is that instead of using all of link traffic as the observable vector we only use the link anomaly vector. </li>
</ul>

<p>By solving an L1 inverse problem we infer the routes (the origin-destination pairs) which gave rise to the link anomalies. Experiments on a very large GPS data set consisting on nearly eight hundred million data points demonstrate that we can discover routes which can clearly explain the appearance of link anomalies. The use of optimization techniques to explain observable anomalies in a generative fashion is, to the best of our knowledge, entirely novel.</p>

</h3>

<p>An important task in exploration of data about phenomena and processes that develop over time is detection of significant changes that happened to the studied phenomenon. </p>

<p>Our research is focused on supporting detection of significant changes, called events, in multiple time series of numeric values. </p>

<p>We developed a suite of visual analytics techniques that combines interactive visualizations on time-aware displays and maps with statistical event detection methods implemented in R. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using two large data sets.</p>
